# WeRateDogs-Twitter-Archive-Data-Wrangling
## Overview
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, commonly known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs and includes a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
## Context
My goal is to investigate and wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

Three datasets were given to perfom this wrangling. These datasets are

- twitter_archive_enhanced.csv
- image_predictions.tsv
- twitter API

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: Pandas, Tweepy, Requests, Matplotlib
